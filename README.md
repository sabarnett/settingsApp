When I started trying to write a Mac app for the first time, I started out knowing what I wanted to achieve but not knowing how to go about it. I spent a lot of time googling for Mac development help and found very little of it. What i did find was mostly related to Objective-C and not Swift/SwiftUI.

So, I spent a lot of time going round in circles, extracting the bits that I thought relevant and heading down a lot of blind alleys.

This project is part of a seried of development notes I want to write to document some of the stuff I learnt along the way. The note that goes with it can be found on my web site.

All but the most basic of apps will need some kind of customisation, provided via settings. There is a simple mechanism for displaying a settings window but the content of that window and how to format that content is entirely up to the developer. This note walks through creating a three tab settings screen.
